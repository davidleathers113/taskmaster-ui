# Comprehensive Test Plan: Electron-Vite Migration Validation

## Overview

This test plan validates the complete migration from Electron Forge to electron-vite, ensuring all functionality works correctly and performance improvements are realized.

## Objectives

- **Primary**: Validate that all existing application functionality works identically post-migration
- **Secondary**: Confirm development workflow improvements and build performance gains
- **Tertiary**: Ensure security, reliability, and maintainability standards are met

## Testing Strategy

### Multi-Layer Testing Approach (2025 Best Practices)

#### 1. Unit Testing (Vitest)
- **Framework**: Vitest (Vite-native testing framework)
- **Scope**: Individual components and utility functions
- **Target**: 90%+ code coverage for critical paths
- **Location**: Co-located with source files

#### 2. Integration Testing (Vitest + Electron Test Utils)
- **Framework**: Vitest with electron-specific test utilities
- **Scope**: IPC communication, process interaction, security boundaries
- **Target**: All main ↔ renderer ↔ preload communication paths

#### 3. End-to-End Testing (Playwright)
- **Framework**: Playwright for Electron applications
- **Scope**: Complete user workflows and cross-platform functionality
- **Target**: Critical user journeys and platform-specific behaviors

## Test Environments

### Development Environment Testing
- **Command**: `npm run dev`
- **Focus**: Hot reloading, development tools, error handling
- **Platforms**: macOS (primary), Windows, Linux

### Production Build Testing
- **Commands**: `npm run build`, `npm run dist`
- **Focus**: Bundle optimization, packaging, distribution
- **Platforms**: All supported platforms (macOS, Windows, Linux)

## Test Categories

### 1. Development Workflow Validation

#### 1.1 Hot Reloading Tests
```bash
# Test hot reload for each process
- Main process changes (src/main/) → App restart
- Preload script changes (src/preload/) → App restart  
- Renderer changes (src/renderer/) → Hot update
```

#### 1.2 Development Server Tests
```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev

# Verify:
- ✅ Vite dev server starts on localhost:5173
- ✅ Electron app launches successfully
- ✅ DevTools accessible and functional
- ✅ Source maps working correctly
- ✅ Console logging preserved
```

#### 1.3 Error Handling Tests
```bash
# Introduce intentional errors and verify:
- ✅ TypeScript errors caught and displayed
- ✅ Syntax errors prevent compilation
- ✅ Runtime errors properly logged
- ✅ Process crashes handled gracefully
```

### 2. Production Build Validation

#### 2.1 Build Process Tests
```bash
# Full build test
npm run build

# Verify output structure:
dist/
├── main/
│   ├── index.cjs
│   └── index.cjs.map
├── preload/
│   ├── index.cjs
│   └── index.cjs.map
├── renderer/
│   ├── index.html
│   ├── assets/
│   └── [optimized chunks]
└── bundle-analysis.html
```

#### 2.2 Bundle Optimization Verification
```bash
# Verify optimization results:
- ✅ Main chunk < 50 kB (target achieved: 48.52 kB)
- ✅ React vendor chunk < 200 kB (achieved: 167.25 kB)  
- ✅ No chunks exceed 500 kB warning threshold
- ✅ Proper code splitting implemented
- ✅ Tree-shaking effective (unused code removed)
```

#### 2.3 Cross-Platform Build Tests
```bash
# Test platform-specific builds
npm run dist:mac    # macOS .dmg
npm run dist:win    # Windows .exe
npm run dist:linux  # Linux .AppImage

# Verify:
- ✅ All platforms build successfully
- ✅ Native dependencies resolved correctly
- ✅ App signatures and notarization (macOS)
- ✅ Auto-updater functionality
```

### 3. Feature Regression Testing

#### 3.1 Core Application Features
```bash
# Test all major application functionality:
- ✅ Task management (CRUD operations)
- ✅ File system integration
- ✅ Project discovery and management
- ✅ Real-time file watching (WebSocket connection)
- ✅ Theme switching and UI preferences
- ✅ Data persistence and state management
```

#### 3.2 Electron-Specific Features
```bash
# Test Electron integration points:
- ✅ Menu bar and system tray functionality
- ✅ Native file dialogs
- ✅ Protocol handling (taskmaster://)
- ✅ Window management (minimize, maximize, close)
- ✅ Native notifications
- ✅ Auto-updater integration
```

#### 3.3 Security Validation
```bash
# Test security boundaries:
- ✅ Context isolation enabled
- ✅ Node integration disabled in renderer
- ✅ Preload script sandboxing (Electron 20+)
- ✅ CSP headers properly configured
- ✅ IPC communication secured and rate-limited
- ✅ External URL handling (shell.openExternal)
```

### 4. Performance Comparison Testing

#### 4.1 Build Performance Metrics
```bash
# Measure and compare:
- Build time (cold build)
- Build time (incremental)
- Bundle sizes
- Startup time
- Memory usage
- CPU usage during development
```

#### 4.2 Runtime Performance Metrics
```bash
# Application performance:
- App startup time
- Initial render time
- Memory footprint
- UI responsiveness
- File watching efficiency
```

### 5. Documentation Validation

#### 5.1 Setup and Development
```bash
# Test documentation accuracy:
- ✅ Installation instructions work
- ✅ Development setup succeeds
- ✅ Commands execute as documented
- ✅ Troubleshooting guides are accurate
```

#### 5.2 Migration Documentation
```bash
# Verify migration guide:
- ✅ Step-by-step process is clear
- ✅ Configuration changes documented
- ✅ Known issues and workarounds listed
- ✅ Before/after comparisons accurate
```

### Mitigation Strategies
1. Comprehensive IPC testing with error scenarios
2. Explicit testing of all native dependency usage
3. Security-focused testing with automated vulnerability scanning
4. Parallel testing on all target platforms
