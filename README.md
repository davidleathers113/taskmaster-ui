## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: Full Setup with Live File Watching (Recommended)

```bash
# Setup everything (UI + File Watcher Server)
npm run setup

# Start both UI and file watcher server
npm run start:all
```

### Option 2: UI Only

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
```

### 🔧 Individual Commands

```bash
# UI Development
npm run dev                # Start UI dev server
npm run build             # Build for production
npm run typecheck         # TypeScript checking
npm run lint              # Code linting

# File Watcher Server
npm run server:install    # Install server dependencies  
npm run server:dev        # Start server in dev mode
npm run server:start      # Start server in production
```

## 🎯 Live Project Management

### 🔥 **NEW: Multi-Project File Watching**

TaskMaster now includes a **revolutionary file watching system** that lets you:

- **📁 Add Multiple Projects**: Connect any project directory with a `tasks/tasks.json` file
- **⚡ Real-Time Updates**: See changes instantly when you edit tasks.json in your IDE
- **🔄 Live Sync**: No more manual refreshes - everything updates automatically
- **🎯 Project Switching**: Toggle between projects with a single click
- **📊 Live Statistics**: See task counts and last update times for all projects

### 🛠️ **How It Works**

1. **File Watcher Server**: Node.js server monitors your project directories
2. **WebSocket Connection**: Real-time communication between server and UI
3. **Automatic Detection**: Finds `tasks/tasks.json` files in your projects
4. **Live Updates**: Changes appear in the UI within milliseconds

### 📁 **Adding Projects**

Click the **"Projects"** button in the top-right corner and either:

const containerVariants = {
  hidden: { opacity: 0 },
  visible: {
    opacity: 1,
    transition: {
      staggerChildren: 0.05,
      delayChildren: 0.1,
    },
  },
}

const itemVariants = {
  hidden: { opacity: 0, y: 20, scale: 0.95 },
  visible: {
    opacity: 1,
    y: 0,
    scale: 1,
    transition: {
      type: "spring",
      stiffness: 400,
      damping: 25,
    },
  },
}
```

## 🎨 Custom CSS Classes

```css
/* Glass morphism effects */
.glass-morphism {
  backdrop-blur: 12px;
  background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1);
  border: 1px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2);
}

/* Gradient text */
.gradient-text {
  background: linear-gradient(to right, #3b82f6, #8b5cf6, #ec4899);
  background-clip: text;
  -webkit-background-clip: text;
  color: transparent;
}

/* Shimmer effects */
.shimmer-effect::before {
  content: '';
  position: absolute;
  inset: 0;
  background: linear-gradient(
    90deg,
    transparent,
    rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2),

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

This UI was crafted with the following principles:

1. **Obsessive Attention to Detail**: Every pixel matters
2. **Physics-Based Motion**: Natural, spring-based animations
3. **Psychological Flow**: UX designed for maximum productivity
4. **Visual Hierarchy**: Clear information architecture
5. **Accessibility First**: WCAG compliant interactions

## 🔧 Configuration

### Tailwind Configuration
The design system includes custom animations, colors, and utilities:

```javascript
// Custom animations
animation: {
  "fade-in": "fadeIn 0.5s ease-in-out",
  "slide-in": "slideIn 0.3s ease-out",
  "scale-in": "scaleIn 0.2s ease-out",
  "glow": "glow 2s ease-in-out infinite alternate",
  "shimmer": "shimmer 2s linear infinite",
  "float": "float 3s ease-in-out infinite",
}
```

### TypeScript Configuration
Strict type checking with path mapping for clean imports:

```json
{
  "paths": {
    "@/*": ["./src/*"],
    "@components/*": ["./src/components/*"],
    "@lib/*": ["./src/lib/*"],
    "@hooks/*": ["./src/hooks/*"],
    "@types/*": ["./src/types/*"],
    "@store/*": ["./src/store/*"],
    "@utils/*": ["./src/utils/*"]
  }
}
```
