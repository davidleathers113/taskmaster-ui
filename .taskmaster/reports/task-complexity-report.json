      "reasoning": "Setting up a robust Electron testing foundation is moderately complex due to the need for multi-environment configuration (main, renderer, preload, integration), mocking Electron APIs, and integrating multiple tools. Each step is distinct and can fail independently, so clear separation into at least 7 subtasks is recommended for clarity and maintainability[2][3][5]."

      "reasoning": "This task is highly complex, involving comprehensive security, lifecycle, and memory testing across multiple Electron processes. It requires deep knowledge of Electron internals, advanced mocking, and security best practices. Each area (lifecycle, updater, IPC, preload, memory) is substantial and should be a separate subtask to ensure thorough coverage and test reliability[2][3][5]."

      "reasoning": "End-to-end testing for Electron with Playwright is very complex due to the need for cross-platform support, UI automation, file system operations, and integration with CI/CD. Each workflow (task management, navigation, file ops, platform checks) is non-trivial and should be handled as a dedicated subtask for maintainability and parallelization[2][3][4]."

      "reasoning": "Performance and memory testing in Electron is complex due to the need for specialized tools (memwatch-next, Electronegativity), cross-platform CI, and the integration of performance metrics into the development workflow. Each aspect (memory, performance, security, CI, reporting) is distinct and requires focused attention to ensure reliability and actionable results[2][3][5]."

      "reasoning": "This task requires understanding Vitest's mocking system, updating configuration, implementing and integrating mocks, and ensuring all tests use the new approach. While not trivial, it is well-scoped and follows established patterns, but involves several moving parts and coordination across configuration, code, and documentation[1][2]."

      "reasoning": "Fixing 200+ TypeScript errors across multiple categories in a large codebase is highly complex. It requires systematic tracking, deep understanding of TypeScript, coordinated refactoring, and ensuring no regressions. Each error type may require a different approach, and the work spans code, configuration, and documentation."

      "expansionPrompt": "Expand into subtasks for analyzing and categorizing warnings, researching ESLint best practices, implementing automated and manual fixes, updating configuration, establishing code quality standards, optimizing performance, conducting developer training, monitoring/reporting, and reviewing documentation.",
      "reasoning": "Addressing over 1400 ESLint warnings is a large-scale code quality initiative. It involves both automated and manual work, configuration changes, team coordination, and ongoing process improvements. While not as technically deep as TypeScript error resolution, the breadth and organizational impact make it moderately complex."
