      "complexityScore": 4,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the backup and migration environment setup into subtasks such as creating backup branches, pushing to remote, creating migration branches, installing dependencies, documenting the current state, and setting up a test plan.",
      "reasoning": "This task is procedural and involves standard git and npm operations, documentation, and initial planning. While important, it is not technically complex but should be broken down for clarity and traceability."

      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "List subtasks for uninstalling Electron Forge packages, removing configuration files, updating scripts, documenting custom configs, cleaning environment variables, and checking codebase references.",
      "reasoning": "Removing legacy configuration requires careful identification and cleanup of dependencies, scripts, and code references. Each step is straightforward but must be thorough to avoid migration issues."

      "expansionPrompt": "Break down into subtasks for updating imports, maintaining contextBridge and IPC, updating paths, verifying security, implementing TypeScript interfaces, enabling hot reloading, and checking CSP.",
      "reasoning": "Preload scripts are security-sensitive and must be carefully migrated to maintain isolation and correct API exposure."

      "expansionPrompt": "Expand into subtasks for creating config files, migrating custom configs, setting up code signing, configuring auto-updater, setting icons, updating metadata, and configuring artifact naming.",
      "reasoning": "Packaging configuration is detailed and must be correct for cross-platform distribution, but follows established patterns."

      "expansionPrompt": "Break down into subtasks for renderer HMR, main process hot reloading, preload hot reloading, adding dev utilities, configuring error handling, setting up logging, testing state preservation, and verifying error overlays.",
      "reasoning": "Coordinating hot reloading across all Electron processes is technically challenging and requires deep integration with the build system and runtime."
